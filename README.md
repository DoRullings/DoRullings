I'm Thomas Gabrielsen - a father of two beautiful children living in Oslo. 

I started my professional career as a toolmaker and visited a number of types of professions before I started to capture my interest in IT in the late 90's. 
I was so fascinated by programming and bought and borrowed countless books at the library about programming. 
I started started my own business in 2001 and have worked in the IT industry for more than 15 years. 

I'm currently find my self develop in Python more often than ever. I really like Python because it's easy to write prototypes/proof-of-concept  programming languages.
